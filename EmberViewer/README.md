# EmberViewer

A modern, cross-platform Ember+ protocol viewer built with Qt5 and libember.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Builds and runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Modern GUI**: Clean Qt5-based interface
- **Connection Manager**: Easy host/port configuration
- **Tree View**: Browse Ember+ provider hierarchy
- **Property Panel**: Inspect parameter details
- **Console Log**: Monitor protocol messages and debugging info
- **S101 Support**: Built-in S101 frame encoding/decoding

## Building

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.9 or later
- C++11 compatible compiler
- Qt5 (Core, Gui, Widgets, Network modules)

### Linux

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make EmberViewer
```

### Windows

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target EmberViewer
```

### macOS

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make EmberViewer
```

## Running

After building, the executable will be located at:
- Linux/macOS: `build/EmberViewer/EmberViewer`
- Windows: `build\EmberViewer\EmberViewer.exe`

Or install system-wide:
```bash
sudo make install
```

## Usage

1. Launch EmberViewer
2. Enter the host and port of your Ember+ provider (default: localhost:9092)
3. Click "Connect"
4. Browse the tree structure of parameters and nodes
5. View the console log for protocol details

## Architecture

EmberViewer is built using:

- **libember**: Core Ember+ protocol implementation
- **libs101**: S101 framing protocol
- **libformula**: Formula evaluation support
- **Qt5**: Cross-platform GUI framework
